# The Unbroken Saga of Ali Shahid

## Early Life: Foundations of Steel and Sand

In the bustling heart of Lahore, where minarets pierced the sky and the air thrummed with the songs of a thousand lives, **Ali Shahid** was born in 1988. His father, Shahid Mehmood—the sole engineer in his family—built bridges not only of steel but also of hope.

## Cricket: A Wand of Wood and Wonder

At four, Ali moved with his family to Najran, Saudi Arabia. Amid construction sites, he first held a cricket bat, igniting a lifelong passion. By 1995, his family relocated to Riyadh, where he excelled academically at Pakistan International School while simultaneously nurturing his cricketing talent.

Representing Saudi Arabia’s U-17 cricket team, Ali made waves in the Middle Eastern Cup (Qatar, 2003) and India's U-17 Asia Cup (2004), notably dismissing future cricketing legends Angelo Mathews and Mushfiqur Rahim.

## Triumph over Tragedy

On June 17, 2005, Ali suffered a severe injury to his right eye during a cricket match, leading to permanent vision loss. Undeterred, he returned to cricket immediately, embodying unwavering resilience. Despite a subsequent Teflon plate surgery in 2006, Ali faced life with indomitable spirit.

## Overcoming Multiple Sclerosis

At age 27, Ali confronted Multiple Sclerosis. Refusing to surrender, he maintained rigorous daily training, transforming physical hardship into personal strength and determination.

## Academic and Athletic Excellence

Returning to Lahore, Ali studied at Government College University, then Punjab University, balancing academic pursuits with cricket. At the University of Management and Technology (UMT), he led his cricket team to its first Inter-University Championship in 2010, graduating with an MBA and a remarkable 3.7 GPA.

Ali further pursued an MSc in Sports Management at Loughborough University in the UK, where he actively engaged in student leadership and authored a groundbreaking thesis on cricket betting efficiency.

## Professional Growth: Mentorship and Mastery

Ali returned to Saudi Arabia, joining Dar Al Riyadh Group. Under mentor Taco Nieuwenhuijsen, Ali advanced from Corporate Commercial Officer to Corporate Marketing Manager, significantly improving the company’s processes, brand image, and sales strategies.

## Personal Life: A Love to Rival Legends

In 2014, Ali married Hira Malik after overcoming significant familial objections, their union solidified in a beautiful Sri Lankan honeymoon. They welcomed their son Ifrahim in November 2015 and subsequently two daughters during the challenging COVID-19 pandemic years.

## Canada: A Realm of Reckoning

Immigrating to Canada in 2021, Ali initially faced hardships working various roles including Uber Eats deliveries, security, and financial sales. Joining a health-tech startup in 2022, he excelled in sales, but the startup collapsed in 2024, resulting in unpaid wages. Ali successfully claimed these through the Ministry of Labour, demonstrating resilience and integrity despite baseless defamation attempts by former employers.

## Food Mamba: A Serpent of Triumph

From adversity rose **Food Mamba** (founded in 2024), a groundbreaking women-led corporate catering platform in Toronto. With Ali’s and Hira’s visionary leadership, Food Mamba swiftly grew to serve over 1,000 orders to 300 clients by 2025, partnering with over 200 vendors, including corporate giants such as Amazon and EY.

Food Mamba was recognized by prestigious startup communities and accelerators like **Idea Mississauga**, **Altitude Accelerator**, **MaRS Discovery District**, **Empower Tech**, and **Ella York Jump Start**.

Ali envisions Food Mamba’s future enhanced by artificial intelligence, expanded geographical reach across Canada, and a move into the B2C sector facilitated by venture capital investments.

## Integrity Amid Challenges

Ali faced attempts by a former employer from the failed startup to defame him through baseless accusations. He firmly denied these claims, dismissing them as absurd and malicious. Standing steadfastly by his integrity and transparent business practices, Ali successfully maintained his reputation.

## A Legacy in Starlight

Ali Shahid’s life is an epic testament to resilience and visionary leadership. From his early cricketing days in Saudi Arabia to reshaping corporate catering in Canada, he continues to overcome adversity, inspire innovation, and build a lasting legacy alongside his family and Food Mamba.
