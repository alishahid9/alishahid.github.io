title: Who is Ali Shahid

# About Me

Ali Shahid was born in Lahore, Pakistan, to Shahid Mehmood—the only engineer in his extended family—whose civil-engineering degree from UET Lahore instilled in Ali a respect for precision and perseverance. At age 4, his family moved to Najran, Saudi Arabia, where he spent sun-baked afternoons whipping a cricket ball against concrete walls and trailing his father through construction sites, absorbing lessons in teamwork, planning, and the discipline of seeing projects through from foundation to finish.

## Early Life & Cricket  
In 1995, Ali enrolled at Pakistan International School in Riyadh, balancing top-fifteen grades with a fearsome pace as a fast bowler in the Riyadh Cricket Association. By 2004, he was Saudi Arabia’s leading wicket-taker at the U-17 Asia Cup in India—claiming scalps like Angelo Mathews and Mushfiqur Rahim and proving that true leaders thrive under pressure.  

A crushing blow to his right eye on June 17, 2005 could have ended his dreams. Instead, Ali returned to Lahore, completed his BSc in Accounting & Finance, and channelled his resolve into captaining UMT Lahore’s cricket team to its first-ever Inter-University Championship in 2010—earning campus headlines and cementing his reputation as a born leader.

## Education & Leadership  
In 2011, Ali crossed continents to pursue an MSc in Sports Management at Loughborough University (UK). He won hall elections within days and mounted a razor-sharp campaign for Students’ Union President under the name “Ali Baba Shahid.” Though he narrowly lost, he mastered the art of persuasion, coalition-building, and stepping beyond his comfort zone to unite diverse voices behind a bold vision.

## Corporate Career in Riyadh  
Returning to Saudi Arabia in 2012, Ali joined Dar Al Riyadh Group. Over five relentless years he rose from Corporate Commercial Officer to Marketing Manager, architecting a company-wide CRM rollout, standardizing operational processes, and leading a digital brand transformation that lifted sales-conversion rates from 6 % to 16 %. Under the crucible of high expectations, he learned that resilience isn’t avoiding failure—it’s meeting it head-on and driving teams to surpass every target.

## Family & Immigration  
In 2014, Ali met Hira Malik. Their transcontinental courtship—dozens of flights and heartfelt appeals—ended in a December wedding in Lahore and a honeymoon in Sri Lanka. By November 2015 they welcomed their first son, **Ifrahim**; two daughters followed during the pandemic. In 2021, the family embraced a new challenge: immigration to Toronto. Ali humbled himself delivering Uber Eats and scheduling security teams, rediscovering empathy for frontline workers and sharpening his problem-solving under pressure.

## Founding Food Mamba  
When a promising sales role at a startup folded in January 2024, Ali saw opportunity in adversity. That February, he and Hira emptied their savings to launch **Food Mamba**: a bootstrapped corporate-catering platform combining an office-meal marketplace with a white-glove event-planning service. In its first year they surpassed USD 1.25 million in bookings and earned the trust of over 300 companies—proof that visionary leadership and relentless execution can turn setbacks into breakthroughs.

Through every pivot—from Najran playgrounds to Riyadh boardrooms, from Loughborough lecture halls to Toronto’s startup trenches—Ali Shahid has forged a hero’s path: one defined by unbreakable conviction, the courage to lead, and the resilience to transform every challenge into an opportunity for triumph.
